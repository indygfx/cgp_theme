Easy Theme
**********

!Important: This theme cannot be used 'out of the box'.  If you go to the theme's listing on the plugin page - you will see a link to [Settings]. Go to the settings page, follow the instructions there, and save the settings.  The theme will now work.  

Note: Adding a "Site Introduction" requires the "Custom Index" plugin. (If you want to use Custom Index without the introduction - you can remove the file  'mod/cgp_theme/views/default/page/layouts/custom-index.php' and Custom Index will return to its default layout.)

This theme is intended as a starting point, I don't expect you to use the design as it is. It is easy to change each section of the theme to match an existing website design, or to create a new design. However, you can start by using the default values and work from there. (Enable the default settings by going to the settings page and saving.)
